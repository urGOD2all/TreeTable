# TreeTable
Light weight TreeTable for Java swing

This is based on some ancient example I got from the way back machine which I tidied up and extended a bit as I used it in a project.

A reasonably naff example is provided for how to use this using the DefaultMutableTreeNode objects. I might make a better one in the future but I think that gives people the gist.

I realize it probably would have made a lot of sense to commit this in bits as I wrote it and tested it but it was a total mess for much of its life!
